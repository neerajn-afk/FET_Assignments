            <h2>Dynamite</h2>
            <p>Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
                So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
                Shoes on, get up in the morn'
                Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
                King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone
                Sing song when I'm walking home
                Jump up to the top, LeBron
                Ding dong, call me on my phone
                Ice tea and a game of ping pong
                This is getting heavy
                Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
                Life is sweet as honey
                Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
                Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
                I'm diamond, you know I glow up
                Hey, so let's go
                'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
                So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
                Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
                So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
                Bring a friend,…
            </p>
            <h2>See you again</h2>
            <p>
                It's been a long day without you, my friend
                And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
                We've come a long way from where we began
                Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
                When I see you again
                Damn, who knew?
                All the planes we flew, good things we been through
                That I'd be standing right here talking to you
                'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
                But something told me that it wouldn't last
                Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
                Those were the days, hard work forever pays
                Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
                Uh
                How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
                Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
                And now you gon' be with me for…
